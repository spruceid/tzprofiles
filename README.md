# Tezos Profiles

Tezos Profiles (TZP) is a web application that helps users regain control 
of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users 
to create portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over 
their public social media and by self-attesting information. These 
verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any 
platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate 
identity fraud.

This project is split into three components. A web app that end-users will
interact with, a worker that will act as a witness, and a smart contract to act
as a registry.
