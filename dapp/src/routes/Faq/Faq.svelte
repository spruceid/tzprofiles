    <div class="mb-8">
      Tezos Profiles (TZP) is a web application where users can associate their
      public online identity based on social media profiles and self-attested
      information to their Tezos address.
    </div>

    <TextBody2 value="How Does it Work?" class="mb-2 font-bold" />
    <div class="mb-8">
      Users can build their profiles with the available credentials on Tezos
      Profiles. Each credential has a unique workflow that must be completed
      prior to credential issuance. Once issued and uploaded, platforms can then
      globally resolve this user-managed information to establish a creator’s
      profile.

    <div class="mb-8">
      Yes - we plan on continually extending support in TZP to also include
      credentials from additional public social profiles to give creators the
      ability to continue to associate their core public profiles.
